After multiple war stories with background jobs, looking at our increasingly complex setup, we wanted something we could use out-of-the-box without having to port our collection of hacks to every new app and with fewer moving pieces. After exploring existing alternatives, we decided to build our own and aim to make it the default for Rails 8.

Perhaps your billing system relies on a subscription management tool, or you utilize email marketing applications to engage customers? Enhancing your features through external tools can be powerful, but testing these integrations could pose challenges or be cumbersome. Join me as we explore practical strategies for testing integrations, drawing from real-life experiences at Harvest, where we implemented several integrations – Braintree, Stripe, CustomerIO, Hubspot, Xero, QuickBooks, and more – and gain confidence in safeguarding your codebase during refactorings or API version changes."

Integrating AI with Ruby on Rails can transform a solo developer’s workflow into an incredibly potent force, capable of competing at an unprecedented scale. This presentation draws on practical real-world experience. We will explore practical approaches ranging from code generation to real-time data analysis and automated customer support. The emphasis is on new tools that let developers focus more than ever on innovation and creativity. Attendees will leave with a roadmap for integrating AI tools and techniques into their Rails projects, insights into the potential pitfalls and best practices, and inspiration to explore the boundaries of what a single developer or a small team can achieve with the right tools."

Fortunately, many of these enhancements are straightforward to implement from day one. My goal is to show folks how to incorporate these types of improvements early in their development process and share my learnings with the broader community."
